# About the Game

This Snake game is based on the Snake EX2, a game for an older Nokia phone, which expands the basic snake with features, like maps, obstacles and moving moving objects.    
The ultimate goal is building a multiplayer feature and add more, like hunger mode and scoreboard on this game.

Avoid walls and the snake body parts.
